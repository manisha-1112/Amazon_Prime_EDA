# Amazon_Prime_EDA_Analysis


The analysis of Amazon Prime’s content library reveals clear opportunities to enhance subscriber growth, retention, and competitive differentiation through strategic, data-driven decisions. By focusing on high-performing content, addressing catalog gaps, and optimizing resource allocation, the platform can achieve sustainable business growth. Below is a detailed yet concise summary of the key insights and actionable strategies derived from the data:  



### **1. Prioritize High-Performing Content**  
The data highlights that **TV shows consistently outperform movies** in both ratings and audience engagement. Specifically:  
- **TV shows** have higher median IMDB scores (7.5 vs. 6.8 for movies) and tighter score clusters, indicating reliable quality.  
- **Newer content (post-2010)** correlates strongly with higher ratings, suggesting modern production standards resonate better with audiences.  
- **Genres like drama, thriller, and action** dominate in viewership and ratings, while comedy shows declining popularity.  

**Action Steps:**  
- **Increase investment in original TV series**, especially in top genres (drama/thriller).  
- **Acquire more post-2010 titles** and prioritize recent releases for promotions.  
- **Audit pre-2010 content**, retaining only high-scoring classics (e.g., IMDB ≥ 7.5).  


### **2. Fix Weaknesses and Catalog Gaps**  
The analysis uncovers underutilized opportunities:  
- **Sci-fi and fantasy** are underrepresented despite their dedicated fanbases.  
- **Low-rated movies (IMDB < 5)** dilute catalog quality and risk subscriber churn.  
- **Older content** varies widely in performance; some classics excel, while others underperform.  

**Action Steps:**  
- **Commission 2-3 original sci-fi/fantasy series annually** to attract niche audiences.  
- **Remove or renegotiate licenses** for consistently low-rated titles (e.g., bottom 10% by score).  
- **Remaster select older titles** with high potential (e.g., cult classics with loyal followings).  


### **3. Leverage Competitive Advantages**  
The data identifies unique strengths to amplify:  
- **Dual high-scorers (IMDB + TMDB ≥ 8)** are rare but highly engaging—ideal for marketing campaigns.  
- **Exclusive partnerships** with top directors (e.g., those averaging 8+ ratings) can differentiate the platform.  
- **Tightly clustered TV show ratings** support a "Quality Guarantee" branding opportunity.  

**Action Steps:**  
- **Launch "Prime Picks" collections** featuring dual high-scoring titles.  
- **Sign exclusive deals** with top-rated creators to build a unique content moat.  
- **Promote TV shows** as "Consistently Great" to emphasize reliability.  



### **4. Optimize Operational Efficiency**  
Resource allocation should align with data insights:  
- **Quality over quantity**: Fewer high-scoring titles drive more value than bulk acquisitions.  
- **Runtime is irrelevant to ratings**: Avoid overpaying for longer content unless tied to proven demand.  
- **Audience trends favor bingeable series**: Prioritize multi-season shows with strong completion rates.  

**Action Steps:**  
- **Shift 70% of content budget** to TV shows and proven genres.  
- **Develop a predictive model** to identify high-potential titles pre-acquisition.  
- **Track "Completion Rate" metrics** to double down on engaging formats.  



### **Implementation Roadmap**  
**Short Term (0–3 Months):**  
- Refresh homepage to highlight top-rated TV shows and newer movies.  
- Run a marketing campaign around "Critically Acclaimed" titles (IMDB/TMDB ≥ 8).  

**Mid Term (3–6 Months):**  
- Partner with 3-5 top directors for exclusive projects.  
- Greenlight 1-2 sci-fi/fantasy originals to test genre demand.  

**Long Term (6+ Months):**  
- Build an AI tool to predict high-scoring content before acquisition.  
- Establish a "Remaster Vault" for vintage content with proven appeal.  



### **Key Metrics to Track Success**  
- **Subscriber Retention Rate**: Target +5% for users watching curated collections.  
- **Avg. IMDB Score of New Adds**: Maintain ≥ 7.5 to elevate catalog quality.  
- **Cost per High-Scoring Title**: Reduce by 15% through predictive analytics.  



### **Final Takeaway**  
By **focusing on proven winners, filling strategic gaps, and leveraging data at every step**, Amazon Prime can transform its content library into a competitive asset. The formula is simple:  

1. **More TV shows, fewer risky movies.**  
2. **New > old, but preserve exceptional classics.**  
3. **Double down on what works, cut what doesn’t.**  

This approach ensures **higher subscriber satisfaction, efficient spending, and standout positioning** in the crowded streaming market. With disciplined execution, these insights can drive measurable growth within 12 months.
